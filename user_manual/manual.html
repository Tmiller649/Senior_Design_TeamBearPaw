    <p>
        Once you're logged in you'll be at the home page. As you can see there are three main components: the daily tracker, account progress, and the middle schedule.
    </p>
    <h3>Daily tracker</h3>
    <img src=".\images\daily-tracker.png" alt="daily tracker">
    <p>
        On the left side of the screen is your daily tracker. This tracker has the record of your daily required nutrition intake. 
        As you update your tracker (by inputting meals nutrition and choosing from our recommender), the value will change. You can track 
        additional nutrition (sodium, sugar) apart from your macros (protein, carbonhydrate, fat).
    </p>
    <h3>Account progress</h3>

    <p>
        On the right side of the screen is your account progress. This tracker has the record of your entire progress, whether you achieve your 
        goal each day or not. Track your progress and maintain your healthy diet!
    </p>
    <h3>Schedule system</h3>
    <img src=".\images\schedule-system.png" alt="Schedule system">
    <p>
        Right in the center is your Schedule. This is where you will be able to input your meal intake. In order to update your meal, 
        simply hover over the date you want and right click. There will be two ways you can update your diet. We will talk more about it.
    </p>
    <h2>Update your diet</h2>
    <h3>Manually input meal</h3>
    <img src=".\images\mealmanual-page.png" alt="manual input meal page">
    <p>
        Here you can find a manual form for you to input your meal. This includes the name of the meal and its nutrition information. Once 
        you include all the required information, you can hit submit, and your daily tracker will be updated accordingly. However, you might 
        think that this is a bit time consuming, and sometimes you're not sure if you know what you want to eat. In the next part, we introduce 
        a solution to the problem: our meal recommender.
    </p>
    <h3>Meal recommender</h3>
    <img src=".\images\mealrec-page.png" alt="Meal recommender page">
    <p>
        Our meal recommender is a simple UI, where we provide you with three options. As you hover through each option, its nutrition information 
        is displayed, and more (you can look through the instructions and make it on your own). If you see what you want, simply click pick meal 
        and it will be automatically added, and your daily nutrition tracker will be updated. If you don't see a viable option, you can click 
        refresh meal and it will simply recommend three new meals for you to choose from.
    </p>
    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h3>How do I add the meal I wanted from the meal recommender?</h3>
    <p>
        When you hover over the recipe card, you will see a pick meal button. Simply click on it, and your meal is added.
    </p>
    <h3>Why does the meal recommender recommends the same meal?</h3>
    <p>
        You will see that after multiple time refreshing the meal, the same meal reappear again. This is one of our current limitations. 
        As you progress and your nutrition intake changes, we'll update the recommender accordingly for better experience in the future.
    </p>
