## Background Description
Nowadays, fitness plays an important roles in our daily life. The need to maintain a healthy and balance lifestyle is increasing. Rather than trying to keep track of daily meal and calories intake by themselves, people start to depend on applications and tools to aid them in their fitness journey.
## Problem Statement
Diet-tracking app is becoming a neccessity for many people. However, the hardest obstacle is to help the user be consistent in their diet and motivate them to use the app regularly to keep track of their diet progress. We created this application with that in mind, and we want to create a user-friendly, quest-based interactive interface. The users can view their journey as a game, with each progress grants achievements and new quests, customize on their own need.
