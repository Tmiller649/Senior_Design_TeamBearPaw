Calculate calories needed a day using Harris Bennedict (BMR - Basal Metallic Rate) formula (link to paper)
Note: this formula does not take weight history and ethnicity into account (link to paper)
Use BMR to estimate total energy expenditure
Use health guidelines to calculate each macro

Taken from DRIs and Dietary guidelines
Added sugar: <10% calories per day
Saturated fat: <10% calories per day
Sodium: <2.3g per day
Carbohydrates: 45-65%
    Fiber: 14g/1000 kcal
Fat: 20-35%
Protein: 10-35% ; 0.8g/kg/day 

**Age from 9-18**
EER for Men = 88.5 - (61.9*age[y]) + PA*(26.7*weight[kg] + 903*height[m]) + 25
EER for Women = 135.3 - (30.8*age[y]) + PA*(10.0*weight[kg] + 934*height[m]) + 25
Physical Activity level -> PA:
Men:
Sedentary: 1
Low active: 1.13
active: 1.26
Very active: 1.42
Women:
Sedentary: 1
Low active: 1.16
active: 1.31
Very active: 1.56

**Age over 19**
EER for Men = 662 - (9.53*age[y]) + PA*(15.91*weight[kg] + 539.6*height[m])
EER for Women = 354 - (6.91*age[y]) + PA*(9.36*weight[kg] + 726*height[m])

Physical Activity level -> PA:
Men:
Sedentary: 1
Low active: 1.11
active: 1.25
Very active: 1.48
Women:
Sedentary: 1
Low active: 1.12

Very active: 1.45

Description:
Sedentary: typical daily living activities (household tasks, walking to the bus...)
Low active: typical daily living + 30-60mins of daily moderate activity (walking at 5-7km/h)
Active: typical daily living + >=60mins of daily moderate activity
Very active: typical daily living + >=60mins of moderate + either 60 mins of vigorous activity/120 mins of moderate

These do not account for weight gain/loss, this is basic for maintaining weight
BMI calc: weight(kg) / [height(m)]**2
<18.5: underweight
18.5<=X<=24.9: healthy weight
25<=X<=19.9: overweight
>=30: obesity

Weight loss macro diets:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763382/
Summary: a large trial to compare the different response to different weight loss diet (focusing on either fat, protein or Carbohydrates).
800 overweight and obese people, 40% are men, 30-70 years of age, BMI from 25-40.
Four diet include (in ratio of fat-protein-Carbs):
- 20-15-65: low fat, ave protein
- 20-25-55: low fat, high protein
- 40-15-45: high fat, ave protein
- 40-25-35: high fat, high protein
Should have option for calories deficit
or opposite of that (200-400-600 deficit-ish)
